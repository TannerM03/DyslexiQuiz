# DyslexiQuiz
## Inspiration
Children with dyslexia face challenges in spelling and reading, often with limited resources available for their assistance. The idea to create a quiz for them emerged from a shared commitment to making a positive impact on their educational journey. Our aim is to provide these children with an engaging tool that not only supports their learning but also promotes equal access to education. The innovative approach we took is designed to captivate dyslexic children's attention, offering a more interactive and enjoyable way to learn. Ultimately, our project may empower these young learners to overcome obstacles and thrive in their academic pursuits.

## What it does
DyslexiQuiz is essentially a quiz application implementing various dyslexic-friendly features to encourage the learning of spelling in children with dyslexia. In our application, we focused on utilizing an OpenDyslexic font, typically accepted as a font more accepted by the dyslexic community. The application also has an EasyReader feature, which enables the user to speak any word they want to learn how to spell into the app to be displayed in the OpenDyslexic font. Furthermore, the application allows the user to track their commitment to learning through the profile page, where they can check off each day they study to accumulate achievements and track their growth.

## How we built it
First, we meticulously researched different practices for the best user-interface for kids with dyslexia. In order to implement these practices, we built this app using Swift and Xcode. Moreover, we added various features such as custom fonts and a tab view to be able to navigate across different pages in the application.

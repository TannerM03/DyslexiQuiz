# DyslexiQuiz

A quiz application implementing various dyslexic-friendly features to encourage the learning of spelling in children with dyslexia. In our application, we focused on utilizing an OpenDyslexic font, typically accepted as a font more accepted by the dyslexic community. The application also has an EasyReader feature, which enables the user to speak any word they want to learn how to spell into the app to be displayed in the OpenDyslexic font. Furthermore, the application allows the user to track their commitment to learning through the profile page, where they can check off each day they study to accumulate achievements and track their growth.
